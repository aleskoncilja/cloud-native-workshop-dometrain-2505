# Building scalable, cloud native, distributed systems in .NET

## Workshop description
Building cloud native distributed systems that are resilient and scalable can be really hard. The number of variables that need to be balanced to build a system that works harmoniously and scales with your customer's needs can be daunting, but it doesn't have to be. Join Nick on this two-day journey to learn how to build scalable and resilient services in .NET using the latest industry standards and bleeding-edge practices.

This workshop will teach you everything you need to know to start building distributed systems in .NET and ASP.NET Core using .NET Aspire and how to combine multiple services to choose the right tool for each use case you might encounter. We will define clear requirements for a system and proceed to build the entire system using all the services and tools you will use to build your own systems later at your company.
